	<h1>Hi, I'm Joanne Dehnbostel!</h1>
	<p>My name is Joanne Dehnbostel. My career path has been multidisciplinary, starting with a career in laboratory science with an emphasis on microbiology and immunology. 
		This led me to study infectious disease epidemiology and biostatistics to try to understand microbiology and immunology at the population level. 
		The process of analyzing this type of data made me aware of the lack of infrastructure for the analysis of scientific evidence for clinical decision support and development of public health policy. 
		For the last two years I have been working as a Research and Analysis manager for a small start up that creates software for the dissemination of scientific data using the Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). 
		Although I have a significant working knowledge of SAS and R software (commonly used for epidemiology and biostatistics) I knew relatively little about software for user interfaces and websites. 
		I recently enrolled in this "bootcamp" for full stack web design to broaden my understanding of JavaScript, node js, REACT, etc. so that I can contribute in my current position with a better technical understanding of our website and webtools.
