	<h1>Hi, I'm Joanne Dehnbostel!</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my Portfolio. This website was created to demonstrate various skills for the MITxPRO Professional Certificate in Coding:Full StackDeelopment with MERN.
		The main site was built with this style on the home and about pages, a css grid style on the projects page and then a Bootstrap Innovations page to explore what Bootstrap had to offer. 
		A few of my early projects are showcased here. I hope to add many more as I progress through the course. Please click the links in the header to explore the site. The links in the footer will take you to external sites for more information.
